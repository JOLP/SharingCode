#Real Time Collaborative Code Editor

#### Abstract

We performanced a number of programming as a compute science students at Kookman University.

We had a variety of questions about the coding project and during a class.
It was inconveniente to visit mento in order to solve this problem.

If it occurs error against the whole of programing not one of the function problems.
It also takes a long analysis time to figure out for entire flow and there are lots of inconvenience in soving this problem.

We believe that if we have a tool which can make a feedback and collaborate among students and assistants to improve among
these inconveniences. 
It will create a strong synergy effect for solving this problem.
