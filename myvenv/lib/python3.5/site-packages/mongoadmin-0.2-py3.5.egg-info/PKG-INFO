Description: django mongoadmin
        =================
        
        This a drop in replacement for the django admin that works with monodb.
        It uses the django admin stuff wherever possible and can be used
        together with normal django models and a SQL database.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Django >= 1.3
        -  `mongoengine <http://mongoengine.org/>`__ >= 0.6
        -  `django-mongodbforms <https://github.com/jschrewe/django-mongodbforms>`__
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add mongoadmin to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'mongoadmin',
                'django.contrib.admin',
                ...
            )
        
        Add mongoadmin to ``urls.py``
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from django.contrib import admin
            admin.autodiscover()
        
            from mongoadmin import site
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
                url(r'^admin/', include(site.urls)),
            )
        
        The ``admin.py`` for your app needs to use mongoadmin instead of
        django's admin:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from mongoadmin import site, DocumentAdmin
        
            from app.models import AppDocument
                
            class AppDocumentAdmin(DocumentAdmin):
                pass
            site.register(AppDocument, AppDocumentAdmin)
        
        Now the document should appear as usual in django's admin.
        
        Using third party apps with mongoadmin
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use third party apps (i.e. apps that register their admin classes in
        ``django.contrib.admin.site``) with mongoadmin you have to add
        ``MONGOADMIN_OVERRIDE_ADMIN = True`` to your settings file. This
        overrides the django admin site with mongoadmin's admin site.
        
        What works and doesn't work
        ---------------------------
        
        django-mongoadmin currently only supports the most basic things and even
        they are not really tested.
        
        You probably won't be able to use all of the nice stuff Django provides
        for relations. The problem is that Django bi-directional relations with
        a lot of magic, while mongoengine has a uni-directional ReferenceField.
        So in order to make relations really work one would either have to
        inject so much code into the documents and querysets that they become
        clones of Django's stuff or rewrite huge parts of the admin. If you feel
        that either approach is worth it, go for it and submit a pull request.
        Otherwise feel free to submit an issue but don't get your hopes up for a
        fix.
